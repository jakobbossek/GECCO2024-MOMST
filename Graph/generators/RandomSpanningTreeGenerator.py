        Sample a random spanning tree.

        The algorithm [1] works by means of Kruskal's algorithm: an empty graph T
        is initialised. Next, the edges of the input graph are travered in random
        order. Let e = {v, w} be the current edge. If deg(v, T) < max_degree and
        deg(v, T) < max_degree and T remains acyclic by adding e, e is added to
        T. The procedure ends once a spanning tree is generated or all edges are
        processed and no feasible d-ST could be produced.

        Sample a spanning tree of a given connected graph using Broder's algorithm.

        Broder's algorithm from 1989 (independently introduced by Aldous in 1990)) samples a random start node v
        uniformly at random. It then performs a random walk starting at v. Edges {v, w} which correspond
        to the first visit of w are added to the growing tree.
        The method has a worst case time complexity of O(n^3) but on average runs in time O(n log n).
