    SIMPLIFIED local version of the scalarised sub-graph mutation operator (SGS) proposed in [1, 2].

    The algorithm extracts an induced sub-graph of the input tree adopting limited BFS. It next calculates
    an MST of the sub-graph by first reducing the edge weights to scalar values by a weighted-sum approach
    and applying Kruskal's single-objective MST
